this has been updated to carry out multithreaded Corda FTP Node functions we run the configuration, would recommend using IntelliJ for this, wait until the nodes have started afyter you run corda FTP nodes, then run the config
then start SenderKt
go to send1
create a .txt with some data
watch the output of either of the running sessions and wait
the file will disappear from that directory and appear under build/DATETIMEOFBUILD/CorpA/incoming_1
